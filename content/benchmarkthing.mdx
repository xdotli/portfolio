Hey A16Z team,

The link in the application form links to here because I only realized from Andrew Chen's tweet that A16Z SPEEDRUN is not just about gaming.

We have been busy talking to potential customers and discussing term sheets with interested investors. Thus we haven't finished a formal pitch deck yet.

If there's any updates on the pitch deck, I will copy the link and puts it in here. Hopefully it will be up by the time you have clicked the link.

Thanks for the understanding!

Xiangyi
