Founded by ex-Tesla, Red Hat, and a GC-backed founder, Benchmarkthing lets AI teams ship evaluation pipelines 80x faster with just three lines of code. Our platform abstracts complex AI benchmarking into an SDK/API, providing seamless integration with the entire LLM product dev lifecycle. We're taking a self-serve, product-led growth approach, with a growing number of early adopters already paying for specialized benchmarks like WebArena.
