ML teams spend weeks finding, running, scaling, and collaborating on scattered AI evaluations/benchmarks. The solution is Benchmarkthing.com â€” the general cloud runtime and marketplace for AI evals. Benchmarkthing was founded by Xiangyi and Moritz, who spent months building evals for Tesla, Princeton researchers, and several YC companies. Within 2 weeks of inception, we generated $2k in revenue with 7 paying users. Both Xiangyi and Moritz are repeat founders. Xiangyi used to work at Tesla, Red Hat, and Dolby, and Moritz raised $2.8M from General Catalyst for RemNote. We're raising a pre-seed round and already have several checks from ai infra founders/angels and tier-1 scout funds committed.
