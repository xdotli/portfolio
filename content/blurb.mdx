ML teams spend weeks finding, running, scaling, and collaborating on scattered AI evaluations/benchmarks. The solution is Benchmarkthing.com â€” the general cloud runtime and marketplace for AI evals. Benchmarkthing was founded after Xiangyi and Moritz who spent months building evals for Tesla, Princeton, and several YC companies. Within 3 weeks of inception, we were able to build generate $2k in revenue with 7 paying users. Both Xiangyi and Moritz are repeat founders. Xiangyi used to work at Tesla, Red Hat, and Dolby, and Moritz raised 2.8M from General Catalyst for RemNote. We're raising a pre-seed round and have several angel checks committed already.
