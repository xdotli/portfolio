What experience do you have that aligns with what we're looking for in this role? *
Proven full-stack skills (>3yrs) at big companies and startups. Highly fluent in many frontend/backend/full-stack frameworks. Highly skilled in TypeScript and Golang. Contributed to world-class software products (Red Hat OpenShift, Dolby Vision) and built two startups from scratch using various tech stacks. Good at communication and collaboration within and across teams. Able to iterate features with high velocity and quality.
Product-wise: I’m obsessed with integrating AI and search into the development workflow. Played around / deployed with A LOT coding assistants: Copilot, Continue (experimented integration with Fauxpilot within Tesla), Codeium, Kite, Supermaven (my favorite), and of course Cody (I knew of the Cody product at the AI Engineer summit last October, and I did a lot of experiments on its previous ability to understand large codebases last year. Kinda did something like Needle In a Haystack test but in a codebase).
Passion wise: I’m actively seeking opportunities to work at an AI startup that can 1) work with the latest technologies / solve the most challenging tasks in software and 2) put my well-rounded skill set and other talents (like curiosity) into proper use.
